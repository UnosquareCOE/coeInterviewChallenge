## Unosquare Coding Challenge

Thank you for your interest in applying for Unosquare.

As part of the selection process we would like to invite you to take part in a coding challenge.

##### The challenge

The aim of the challenge is to add code to already written classes so that the unit tests run successfully. 

##### Steps

1. Download the repository by either:
      1. Installing Git and forking the repository 
      2. Download as a zip file
2. Install Java 11+
3. Install Gradle (https://gradle.org/install/)
4. Examine the code and tests carefully
5. Add a code implementation to the `Circle`, `Rectangle` and `Square` classes
7. Choose **ONE** of the methods in the `Algorithms` class and add a code implementation
8. In the `AlgorithmsTest` class, uncomment the unit test that is appropriate to the method you chose to implement in the `Algorithms` class.  eg. if you chose to implement code for the `calculateSumOfEvenNumbersInCollection` method
then uncomment the `calculateSumOfEvenNumbersInCollection_returns_expected_result` method in the `AlgorithmsTest` class.
9. After you are happy with your code implementation, run the tests by typing `gradle test` or within an IDE.
10. When the tests execute successfully either:
    1. Create a git branch with your name, push your code, and create a pull request.
    2. Zip up the repository and send to [katrina.jones@unosquare.com](mailto:katrina.jones@unosquare.com)

Any questions please send an email to [chris.simpson@unosquare.com](mailto:chris.simpson@unosquare.com)

Good luck!
